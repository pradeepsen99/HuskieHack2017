# HuskieHack2017
The repository used for the group in Huskie Hacks 2017. Team members are Tomas, Pradeep, Ridas and Albert. The main idea of this project is to have an offline version of a disaster handbook. This serves useful in times of crisis where people are not sure what to do. This project ended up winning tee prize for a UE Roll 2.
